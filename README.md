# Repository Pattern: Simple, Asynchronous and Generic
I wrote it for myself but who knows where it would appear...

## Benefits
1. Asynchronous (programmed with *``IAsyncEnumerable``, ``Task``*)
2. Generic (*T* - that's your stuff)
3. EF-connected (EF5)
4. Server-size pagination enabled
5. Usage explanation through tests

## Usage || restrictions
``git clone`` | Ctrl+C => Ctrl+V
  
No restriction for you. Take it, modify, use!
  
*Just set reference to this Github page, please*

## Test
Run: ``dotnet test``
